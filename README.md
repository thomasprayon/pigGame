Pig game project.  
Players take turns to roll a single dice as many time as they want, adding all the numbers to a total. Unless the player gets a 1. 
In this case, the player looses every gained score and it's next players turn. Each player, if they are lucky in not rolling a 1 can hold their total points, and gives the dice to the other player.
