Pig game project
Players take turns to roll a single dice as many time as they want, adding all the numbers to a total.
Unless the player gets a 1. In this case, the player looses every gained score and it's next players turn.
Each player, if they are lucky in not rolling a 1 can hold their total points, and gives the dice to the other player. 
The objective of the game is to reach 100 points before the other player.
